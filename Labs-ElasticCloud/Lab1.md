_Occasionally we have seen issues with browsers - usually email not showing up. If it’s not going the way as the lab points out - please try to use another browser._
_Corporate email servers have blocked the cloud trial emails, a non-corporate email may do the trick_

4. Log in and create give your account a strong password.

11. You should see 2 Data nodes that will be deployed across 2 zones.  During the trial, you will not be able to change the size of them. If this wasn’t a trial account, changing the size of the ES nodes or the # of nodes is a slider-away!

12.  Turn on **<code>Machine Learning </code></strong>by clicking <strong><code>Enable</code></strong>.

Your cluster’s Architecture should look similar to this. Notice that APM server is part of the deployment and hosted for use as well.

13.  Click **<code>Create Cluster</code></strong>. Your cluster will begin to spin up.  It takes between 3 - 6 minutes to complete.

<img src="/Labs-ElasticCloud/images/img13.png" alt="virtual_class" width="300" height="50">

Please copy** Cloud ID, username, **auto generated** password, **and** APM Server secret token **for later use. Please paste it into a text editor of your choice for now.  \

14.  When the cluster is ready, select your deployment in the top left, under **Deployments**. Scroll down to get used to having all information about your deployment at a single place.

This is where you can find the URLs for Elasticsearch, Kibana, and APM. 

15.  Click on **<code>Launch</code></strong> under Kibana to launch it in a new tab.  Login with the username <strong><code>elastic</code></strong> and your password (this is the password you copied in Step 13).

**_[Note: If you forgot to copy your password earlier, you can always reset it to get a new password under the Security section of your deployment]_**

That’s it for this lab! You have a deployment now ready to start ingesting and working with the data.
